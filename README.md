# Sushi Violation 2018 (20XX Edition) #
A reworked version of Sushi Violation 2018 for 1080p/4K!

Important notes:

-Once you use this theme, you can't change back unless you edit Preferences.ini! This theme is designed to be a standalone game, I wouldn't recommend using it if you plan on switching themes.

-You *NEED* to install the noteskins into the NoteSkins/dance folder of your SM engine, the theme does not read other noteskins besides the ones packaged with the theme. You can edit 03 PlayerOptions to have your noteskin selected.
